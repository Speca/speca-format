#################################################### CUSTOM METHOD ATTRIBUTES #########################################

# Custom method attributes (aka properties) are designed to be an extension point for API methods documentation;
# They could be used to extend method definitions with any information you want in a way Speca platform understands
# and provides an extra features based on these attributes like filtering by attribute presence or by attribute value
# as well as include them into final specification
#
# The good examples of custom attributes can be:
#     **deprecated** mark or **authentication type** or **implementation status** etc...
#
#
# Attribute definition consists of:
# name     - attribute name (required); if you don't specify anything else than attribute became some sort of tag, e.g.  deprecated
# options  - array of possible values for this attribute (string, optional)
# desc     - attribute description
# required - if attribute value is required for all methods
# multiple - if attribute allows multiple values, e.g. Authentication: Basic, Key
#
# Attribute specified for a method are displayed in right-top corner panel in view mode??
